"""
Simple Bot to count how much you poop :)

First, a few handler functions are defined. Then, those functions are passed to
the Dispatcher and registered at their respective places.
Then, the bot is started and runs until we press Ctrl-C on the command line.

Usage:
/start - start the poop competition
/poop - increase the poop count

Press Ctrl-C on the command line or send a signal to the process to stop the bot.
